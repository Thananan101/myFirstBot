# myFirstBot
My first Discord.py bot can play music, keep track of how many times a person types in the message channel (leveling system), read email, and obtain a zoom link for you, among other things.
PS. Please don't mind bad words, the purpose of my discord bot is to entertain my friends while i has something to do with coding.
